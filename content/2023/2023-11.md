## Geeking - podcasts

Google announced that they are shudding down Google podcasts and will move the functionality to Youtube Music. In the meanwhile I am probably switching to use Antenna Pod as my main podcast player. In order to sync episodes and subscriptions between devices, I am looking at running one of these services locally:
* [gpodder2go command - github.com/oxtyped/gpodder2go - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oxtyped/gpodder2go)
* [podsync — Rust application // Lib.rs](https://lib.rs/crates/podsync)

Idea: if I ever want to play with cloud - look at using one of the above items to run as a service for public.


## Geeking 

* Trying to use [clifm](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction) - command line file manager
* Set up [immich](https://immich.app/) for my photos stored on network drive.
* Finished this Chat GPT intro course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng)

## Geeking with my son

* Got a micro:bit. Connected that to his tablet running Scratch. Yay! It looks cool.

## Cooking

* Cooked eggplant in an Airfryer
  * Cut in half, oil and sal.
  * Cook for about 10 minutes at 200C and 5 more minutes at 180C
