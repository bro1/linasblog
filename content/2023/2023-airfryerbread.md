I have done a small experiment - baked bread in an air fryer.

I am sure I used quite a bit less energy as compared to oven.

It's definitely not as flexible of what shape I can bake, but the crust was crunchy and it tasted right.

I have bought a special baking tin for the air fryer though.

## Method

This is the first time I tried it, but here is the info.

450g of flour + 1 cup of water + 65g of sour dough starter + 1 tsp salt + 2 tbsp oil

Airfryer:
- 3 minutes preheat
- 10 minutes at 200C
- 10 minutes at 180C
- then I took it out of the basket, turned the bread over
- 5 more minutes at 180C

## On the shoulders of giants

My starting guidance/idea for the baking process was based on this: [https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/air-fryer-bread/](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/air-fryer-bread/)
