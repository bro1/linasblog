> Shopfiy made waves in early January when it abruptly removed 12,000 regularly occurring meetings and events from employees’ calendars without notice and introduced a slew of new policies designed to discourage them going forward.
> 
> “We canceled all current calendar meetings that had more than two people in them, we instituted no-meeting Wednesdays, we introduced asynchronous meeting tools, and we made sure that team meetings could only be held in a very small block on Thursdays,” says Nejatian. “Our goal was to create uninterrupted time for our most precious resources, which is the crafters that build software.” (After two weeks, staff were able to schedule meetings on Wednesdays again, but only after accepting a notification reminding them of the policy.)
