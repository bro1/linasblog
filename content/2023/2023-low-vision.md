**Need:** I would like for my blind relative to be able to listen to audio books and podcasts. 

I'd like to be able to have a cheep internet connected system to help with that, so that I could put some more audio files onto that gadget.

It would be great to use commodity hardware so that absolutely anyone could build similar system.

I envisage Android phone with numeric hardware keyboard with just a few things:
* a custom launcher that can be controlled by numeric keyboard
* an audio book player that can be controlled by numeric keyboard
* a podcast player that can be controlled by a numeric keyboard


### Launcher functionality

* 0: start launcher
* 1: start audio book app
* 2: start podcast app

### Audio book functionality

* 0: play book
* 1: previous chapter
* 3: next chapter
* 4: previous book (and maybe read book title)
* 6: next book (and maybe read book title)

### Podcast functionality

* TBD

### Synchting

* to help put things on the Android device

### Why numeric keyboard?

* It has enough keys to control audio apps
* It's available anywhere
* It has few enough keys so that people who cannot see could easily remember the few keys that they need

### What is numeric keyboard?

### What can this be based on?

* Audio book player Voice [github link](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice)
  * My branch of Voice audio book player [github](https://github.com/bro1/Voice)
