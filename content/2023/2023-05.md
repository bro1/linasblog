## Books, audio books and reading

* Still listening [Leviathan Falls (The Expanse, #9) by James S.A. Corey | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335699-leviathan-falls)

## Cooking

* [Pasakiškas trupininis pyragas su džiovintais abrikosais: kepsit vėl ir vėl | Gyvenimas | 15min.lt](https://www.15min.lt/gyvenimas/naujiena/maistas/pasakiskas-trupininis-pyragas-su-dziovintais-abrikosais-kepsit-vel-ir-vel-1632-2039168) - the recipe is too large, so halving that and cooking it.
* I borrowed a cook book by Adam Liaw from the library. But his web site [Recipes & Articles – adamliaw.com](https://adamliaw.com/recipes-articles/) seems to have a lot of nice recipes.

## Food, global climate change, GMO, medicine, skepticism

* [Westinghouse unveils small modular nuclear reactor](https://news.yahoo.com/westinghouse-unveils-small-modular-nuclear-131630405.html)
* [How Two British Orthodontists Became Celebrities to Incels - The New York Times](http://web.archive.org/web/20230418162817/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/magazine/teeth-mewing-incels.html) ([web archive link](http://web.archive.org/web/20230418162817/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/magazine/teeth-mewing-incels.html))
