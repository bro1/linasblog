## Geeking - set multiple alarm clock entries on Android

* Built an Android app to set alarms in the default alarm app based on a list of entries that look like "13:30 Meeting about something". The alarms are set 2 minutes before the meeting.
* Also built a little Java app to take Outlook export and print the list of meetings in the above format
* Android and Android Watch handle these alarms very well and makes it easier not to miss the meetings

To become a tester for this Android app register on the [web](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/nz.theysay.addalarms) or in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.theysay.addalarms)

## Life pro tip

**Send many photos instead of one postcard**. There are multiple services that allow you to upload a bunch of photos, pay for printing them. Just make sure that you entering a delivery address of the person to whom you are sending those photos to (hey granddad-in-law!) :)

If you want to include a message - you can always design a picture to be printed alongside with your photos in something like [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/sp/). 

For this type of photo printing I use [Diamond Photo](https://diamondphoto.co.nz/) in NZ and a similar service in Lithuania.
