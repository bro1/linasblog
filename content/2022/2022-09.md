## Geeking - set multiple alarm clock entries on Android

* Built an Android app to set alarms in the default alarm app based on a list of entries that look like "13:30 Meeting about something". The alarms are set 2 minutes before the meeting.
* Also built a little Java app to take Outlook export and print the list of meetings in the above format
* Android and Android Watch handle these alarms very well and makes it easier not to miss the meetings

## Reading

* Finishing listening to audio book [Abaddon's Gate (The Expanse, #3)](https://www.goodreads.com/ca/book/show/16131032-abaddon-s-gate)
