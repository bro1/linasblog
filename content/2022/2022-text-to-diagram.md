* [RedDress - styling for Plant UML diagrams](https://github.com/Drakemor/RedDress-PlantUML)
* [Svelvet](https://www.svelvet.io/) - Svelte component library for building interactive node-based flow diagrams. Too simple for a lot of needs, but it has nice animation on the connectors between nodes, that could be used for showing default user flows, or highlight information flow through the system.
