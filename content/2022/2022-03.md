# Bye Spotify and your crazy schemes of giving money to people who spread disinformation

I have used [spotify-to-deezer](https://github.com/Fer99n/spotify-to-deezer) - open source python tool to transfer music from Spotify to Deezer. Unfortunately it has a few defects. 

Also some bands do not have the same name in Spotify as they have on Deezer. Korn vs Ko–Øn and some non-english bands sometimes write their names in latina alphabet, sometimes in their native alphabet. 

So.... I fixed some of the defecs in my local copy, then threw away most of the stuff, added band name translation build a few extra scripts in go lang.

The end result is that now I have absolute majority of my music on Deezer.

## Raspberry Pi as a smart music player

Ordered raspberry pi and received mini computer.

I have set up https://moodeaudio.org/ on it and connected it to soundbar. Moode is running an open source project MPD (Music Player Demon) on it.

Then I built a Java program to go through all my music collection and create a new playlist in MPD with the songs that I have rated 3 stars or more.

## Android app for playing RNZ news

RNZ releases news audio clip every 1 hour. So I have built a little android app which has only 2 buttons:
1. play news locally (it just looks up the stream and launches a local media player - in my case VLC)
2. play news on MPD (on my new Raspberry Pi) - in which case it just looks up the relevant news http stream and adds it to MPD playlist.

I love how instantanious it is!

I think I will tweak it a bit and publish the app to the Google Play store.

## Android app for covid-19 locations of interest

In February I used Flutter to build an Android app to display locations of interest that are relevant to me based on open data provided by the Ministry of Health. 

Then registered Google playstore account.

I was ready to publish the application and on the day I was planning to do that NZ government decided not to release any more updates for locations of interest (due to Omicron all NZ became the location of interest).
