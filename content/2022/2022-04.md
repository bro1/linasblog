## Geeking - Azure

* Set up an Azure account (Cosmos DB + Java Spring Boot application on Azure App Service), moving part of my Lithuanian Media Monitoring to use this set up.
* Set up a new stored procedure on Cosmos DB.
* Deployed most of my changes that I was planning to - and realised that Azure free tier is barely capable to start Spring Boot based app with allocated amount of short CPU bursts, it looks that it then kills the app and then consumes the next 5 minute CPU burst to start the app again. I'd say fairly lousy free tier.

## Geeking

* Updated Hugo static file generator template for this blog - moved most of the older articles to a menu.
* I have subscribed to TLDR  daily newsletter. So far I like it.
* Checked out [Chrome OS Flex](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-save-old-laptop-install-chrome-os-flex-chromeboo-1848714108) on my old laptop. Looks nice.
* Trying to publish my RNZ news app to Google Play Store. The process is quite tricky - multiple graphics, descriptions, questionnaires and so on. Taking me at least 2 days to publish (considering that it took me only about 2 evenings to create the app it's really annoying).
* Relocated Android SDK to a non-standard location
* Finally set up my printer to work on Linux

## Geeking at work

* Helping the teams to assess whether we need to worry about Spring4Shell vulnerability.
* Using vim for my notes (instead of notepad++) and learning a few new things: block editing and vimgrep

## Geeking - vim

Make sure to launch links from vim to MS Edge using gx keyboard combination
```
:nnoremap gx :!/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Microsoft/Edge/Application/msedge.exe <cWORD> &<CR><CR>
```

`ctrl+v` - enable block mode
