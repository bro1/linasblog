## Geeking for work

* IT security training on [SafeStack Academy](https://academy.safestack.io/) - lab excercises fun, theory - boring.
* Playing with [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)
* Sometimes, you have to resolve some warning (log4j), before unmasking the error (DB tablespace out of space), then resolve the error before hitting another (one of the JVM agents out of licenses) which may have been a red herring, and stumbling upon a coincidence where OS allocated the same port for another application. Easy peasy pie!

## Geeking and security

* [npm ci ignores package-lock.json file](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2701) - this security issue has been open for about a year now :(

## Music and geeking

* Spotify is screwing up royally by paying podcasters to create covid-19 desinformation podcasts. So if you are one of many people who have decided to ditch Spotify and want to migrate to something like Deezer or youtube music, or something else - you have a few tools: 
  * [spotify-to-deezer](https://github.com/Fer99n/spotify-to-deezer) - open source python tool to transfer playlists
  * [soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/) - service to transfer music and playlists (limited funcitonality for free, full functionality - paid)
