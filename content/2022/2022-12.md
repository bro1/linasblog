## Geeking

* Installed ChromeOS Flex on my old laptop from 2012 - it seems to be working quite well. Good job Google!
* I have moved 3 Android apps from my older PC to the current one and published them on github:
  * [ShieldsAndLives](https://github.com/bro1/ShieldsAndLives) - a mini game to help my son learn times table.
  * [weather_nz](https://github.com/bro1/weather_nz) - a small and fast app to display metservice weather forecast for Wellington
  * [AddAlarmsAndroid](https://github.com/bro1/AddAlarmsAndroid) - use this app to set many alarms at once - this app just issues commands in bulk to set alarms in your default Android clock.
* Set up [Immich](https://immich.app/) on my spare laptop.
