## Geeking

* Created an OPML export for my hoby project.  If you need to write out XML in go - the most important documentation to read is [Marshal method](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/xml#Marshal). This explains the meaning of all the annotations required in structs to achieve the desired XML structure.
* Updated template for this blog: no more pagination, also only display a list of titles in the menus 

## Geeking at work

* It's quite fun to dive into code of 5 or so systems and their documentation, to try to figure how session timeout is supposed to work.
* It's fun to figure out where exactly one web service gets its data from. Sometimes you do not need to fix code, just fix underlying data.
* Thinking and writing up reporting capabilities of Curam
