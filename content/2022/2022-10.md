## Reading

* Continuing reading [The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2021 by Ed Yong](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55959453)
* Finished listening to audio book [Cibola Burn (The Expanse, #4)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656030-cibola-burn)

## Watching

* Rick and Morty

## Watching - The IT Crowd

I have watched this [US pilot of The IT Crowd](https://archive.org/details/the-it-crowd-us-pilot): 

Verdict: not worth watching - it's too similar to the original 1st episode of the UK original IT Crowd. Watch the original instead - on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70116817).
