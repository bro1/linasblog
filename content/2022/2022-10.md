## Geeking

* Got a new laptop - spent a few evenings setting it up the way I like. Finger print scanned is not working on Linux :(

## Reading

* Continuing reading [The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2021 by Ed Yong](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55959453)
* Finished listening to audio book [Cibola Burn (The Expanse, #4)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656030-cibola-burn)
* Started and finished listening to audio book [Nemesis Games (The Expanse, #5)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886612-nemesis-games) - got it via Kobo audio book subscription trial.
* Next one in the queue [Babylon's Ashes (The Expanse, #6)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25877663-babylon-s-ashes)

## Cooking

* [BBC Good Food: Beef ragout recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/beef-ragout)
* [Stuff: Recipe Simple beef rendang](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/in-the-kitchen/5276515/Recipe-Simple-beef-rendang?cid=PDM726207&bid=1478220307)
* [Creamy Vermouth Chicken Recipe on Food52](https://food52.com/recipes/88134-creamy-vermouth-chicken)

## Cooking - gluten free

During the school holiday I had to babysit a couple of children. One of them cannot have gluten, hence gluten free cooking.

* [YouTube: America's Test Kitchen - Science: Secrets to Making & Baking the Best Gluten-Free Pizza Dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh50Cht9tUc)
* [Gluten-Free Pizza Crust - Gluten-Free Palate](https://www.glutenfreepalate.com/gluten-free-pizza-9-ingredients/)

## Watching

* Rick and Morty

## Watching - The IT Crowd

I have watched this [US pilot of The IT Crowd](https://archive.org/details/the-it-crowd-us-pilot): 

Verdict: not worth watching - it's too similar to the original 1st episode of the UK original IT Crowd. Watch the original instead - on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70116817).
