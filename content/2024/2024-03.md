## Geeking 

* I am using Immich for photos. I have encountered this defect and resolved it by reindexing users table [[BUG] Suddenly incorrect email or password · Issue #5907 · immich-app/immich · GitHub](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/issues/5907)
* I have written a [macro for Google Sheets](https://gist.github.com/bro1/395a84162e5379ab25b24796aebfdbec)  - to generate and store 7 random numbers in a Google Sheet - this allows to generate a weekly meal plan using lookups from a list of recipes that I typically cook.

## Reading

* Listening to an audio book [One Summer: America, 1927](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Summer:_America,_1927) - a 2013 history book by Bill Bryson. 

## Cooking

* I have now perfected Lithuanian Čeburėkai recipe. I have started making them in 2018 with a recipe based off a website. But the dough was too sticky, and the quanities were inexact and the amount of salt was specified as "a pinch" or dill as a "punnet", and the dough kept sticking. So every single time I was making čeburėkai I was tweaking the recipe and notes. I think I now the perfect recipe with the right quantities and the right flavour profile for a family of 3 (recipe TBD).
