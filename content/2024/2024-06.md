## Geeking

I have built the first app using Kotlin and Android Jetpack Compose.

The app looks for mp3 files in a specific directory, extracts metadata and displays the list. For each file it allows me to:
- open the Spotify search for that song
- open the Youtube Music search for that song
- delete the file (only if the rating for that song is less than 3 stars)
