## Geeking

* Trying out Java Profiling with [Java Flight Recorder](https://www.baeldung.com/java-flight-recorder-monitoring) and [Java Mission Control](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk-mission-control.html). Useful for work.
* Reading about FlutterFlow, Firebase, Couchbase Sync
* Updated this blog using (Hugo)[https://gohugo.io/] so that homepage would always display the latest post in full.

## Geeking - Android app dev

This is an important [environment variable](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables): ```ANDROID_AVD_HOME``` Sets the path to the directory that contains all AVD-specific files, which mostly consist of very large disk images. The default location is $ANDROID_EMULATOR_HOME/avd/. You might want to specify a new location if the default location is low on disk space.

## Android apps

[Smart Bookmark: Manage Bookmarks Smarter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangleness.smartbookmark) - there are a few websites that I check nearly daily. So I saved them in this simple app (no synchronisation to anything, but you can save backup and restore backup).
