## Geeking

* Installed diagrams.net [desktop application](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/latest)
* Read a children's book [Gently down the stream](https://www.gentlydownthe.stream/) - a gentle introduction to Apache Kafka
* Trying out [cudatext editor](https://cudatext.github.io/)
* Android share replacement utility [Sharedr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rejh.sharedr) - my Redmi Note Android update broke the Android system share functionality and this one fixed it and made it better! 

## Podcasts

* 99% invisible episode [449 - Mine!](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mine/)
* Risky Business
* Skeptics Guide to the Universe
* Skeptics with a K
* BBC More or Less: [The Freedom Day Gamble](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000y49w)
* Darknet diaries: [The Pizza Problem](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/97/)

## Cooking

## Eating out

* [Stuff - Wellington's best cheap eats: Hand-pulled noodles and a pizza shop in a converted public toilet](https://i.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/nz/wellington/300362137/handpulled-noodles-and-a-pizza-shop-in-a-converted-public-toilet-wellingtons-best-cheap-eats)

## Reading

* Continue reading [Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17573681-spillover)

I have just realised that a paper version of Spillover is 592 pages long. That explains why my e-book progress bar moves slowly.

## Travel

* Spent a week in Queenstown.

Curam - [configurable validations](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/7.0.11?topic=configuration-working-configurable-validations). 

Check which validations can be safely disabled by running this query:
