* [Simple Gallery - Photo and Video Manager & Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.gallery)
* [Markor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor) - markdown editor
* [Delete Current Playlist Song - Spotify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.virock.deletecurrentplaylistsong_spotify) - When I find a new album by a band I like, I add it to the "To Listen" playlist on Spotify. Spotify does not make it easy to remove songs from the playlist on mobile. So Here is the app that allows to remove the currently playing song from the playlist.
* [Mirror](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mirrorai.app) - make emojis based on your photo.
* [Smart Bookmark: Manage Bookmarks Smarter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangleness.smartbookmark) - there are a few websites that I check nearly daily. So I saved them in this simple app (no synchronisation to anything, but you can save backup and restore backup).
* [Sharedr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rejh.sharedr) - Android share replacement utility
* [mgit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manichord.mgit) - git client for Android
