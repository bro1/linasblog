## Podcasts

* Skeptics with a K - [301](http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/2021/04/skeptics-with-a-k-episode-301/)
* Chariot Solutions - [37](https://chariotsolutions.com/podcast/techchat-tuesdays-37-opensearch-rust-rails-of-react/)

## Food in Otaki and Waikanae

* [Otaki Kitchen](https://otakikitchen.business.site/) - really enjoyed the food there.
* [Cafe 66](https://cafe-sixty-six.business.site/) - nice breakfast and coffee, but their menu online is not up to date.
* [Salt and Wood collective](https://www.foodfolk.co.nz/salt-and-wood/) in Waikanae - great meats. Next time we will order one portion of meat + some sides to share as individual orders were a bit too large for us.

## Reading

* Still reading [The Ministry for the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/50998056-the-ministry-for-the-future)
