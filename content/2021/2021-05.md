## Food in Otaki and Waikanae

* [Otaki Kitchen](https://otakikitchen.business.site/) - really enjoyed the food there.
* [Cafe 66](https://cafe-sixty-six.business.site/) - nice breakfast and coffee, but their menu online is not up to date.
* [Salt and Wood collective](https://www.foodfolk.co.nz/salt-and-wood/) in Waikanae - great meats. Next time we will order one portion of meat + some sides to share as individual orders were a bit too large for us.
