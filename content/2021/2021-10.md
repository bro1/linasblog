## Geeking

* [dart http package does not have support for cookies](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/issues/170)
* [git client for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manichord.mgit)
* [Built a little dashboard with Google Charts and javascript](https://laisvamaniai.com/2021/10/lietuvoje-nuo-covid-19-daugiausiai-mirsta-neskiepyti/) to track the deaths from covid-19 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated population. Vaccines do work!
* Used [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for the first time (to extract details from Lithuanian covid-19 stats json data file)

## Geeking for work

* I have attended an intro hands on training for [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/openshift/)
* I love going through code, DB and logs to understand why an issue happens. I feel like a detective.
* Compromised package [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w) does not affect us.
