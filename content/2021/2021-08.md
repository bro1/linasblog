## Geeking

* PC upgraded to [Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_uma_cinnamon_whatsnew.php)
* Looking at the code of [pocket2rm](https://github.com/GliderGeek/pocket2rm) tool that converts Pocket articles and saves them for reading on reMarkable tablet. Something like this could be done to generate epub files from Pocket.  

## Geeking at work

* Covid-19 lockdown means that my work is asking to do urgent changes to the processes that have not been designed in the system. 

## Geeking - cat

My cat keeps sitting on my laptop's keyboard. Even when the screen is locked, it manages to turn off wifi, reboot everything, or make the PC unresponsive. While I do like having 2 screens, I have made a decision to configure the laptop, so that the laptop would not shutdown, when I close the lid.


I have added the following to my i3/config file:
'''
exec --no-startup-id mate-power-manager
'''     

mate-power-manager is set up to do nothing, when laptop lid is closed.
