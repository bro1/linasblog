## Geeking

* Started building a little Android app for displaying weather in Wellington. Official Metservice app and website are veeeery slow. Their API is very fast. The first version is already on my phone :)
  * These [unicode characters](https://www.alt-codes.net/weather-symbols.php) are quite useful for weather app
 

## Geeking - tools to take a look at

* [collect](https://github.com/getodk/collect) - ODK Collect is an Android app for filling out forms. It's been used to collect billions of data points in challenging environments around the world.

* Just drawing diagrams this month and preparing for quarterly planning.
